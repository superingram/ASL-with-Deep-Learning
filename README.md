# ASL-with-Deep-Learning
In this project, I will train a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters.  After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, the network will be defined, compiled, trained, and its performance tested.  One-hot encoding will be utilized for preprocessing.  The mistakes will be visualized.
